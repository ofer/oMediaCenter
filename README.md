# oMediaCenter
Another media center, web based, plugins to handle where the sources come from

Knows to transcode between avi, mkv, and mpeg4's that can't play on browsers to mp4's that can or HLS (uses ffmpeg)

## Current plugins
### uTorrent Plugin
uTorrent plugin can be set to read a utorrent web site and serve the files based on the directory given.
### Transmission plugin
Reads Transmission bittorrent data to serve files generated by transmission
### Directory scanner plugin
Set a directory or set of directories in the app config, it'll scan for files that can be served (mp4 and mkv)

## Future Ideas
* Add libtorrent plugin
* Change from polling to "push", since signalR is now used for client commands, this is not far
